<h2>Coverage per phylum, based on the mapping of PacBio reads to the assembly</h2>
<p>This analysis maps the read data (typically PacBio HiFi reads) to the input genome using minimap2 and calculates the average coverage per sequence. Coverage information is then aggregated by phylum, which can help identify sequences with abnormal coverage that might represent contamination or cobionts. Sequences from the target organism typically show consistent coverage, while contaminants often have different coverage patterns.</p>
