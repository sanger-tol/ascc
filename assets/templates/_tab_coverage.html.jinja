<h2>Coverage per Phylum</h2>

<div class="narrow-text-container">
<p>This analysis maps the read data to the input genome using minimap2 and calculates the average coverage per sequence. Coverage information is then aggregated by phylum, which can help identify sequences with abnormal coverage that might represent contamination or cobionts. Sequences from the target organism typically show consistent coverage, while contaminants often have different coverage patterns.</p>

<p><em>Note: Read type and layout information can be found in the Input tab under Input Parameters.</em></p>
