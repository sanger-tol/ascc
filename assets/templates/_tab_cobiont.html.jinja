<h2>Cobiont Check Merged Table</h2>
<p>This comprehensive table combines results from multiple analyses (GC content, coverage, Tiara, Kraken, k-mer dimensionality reduction, Diamond, BLAST, FCS-GX, BlobToolKit) for each sequence in the input assembly. It provides a phylum-level combined classification of the input sequences, using BlobToolKit's 'bestsum_phylum' first, then filling gaps with results from Tiara and nt Kraken. The 'merged_classif' column shows the classification, while 'merged_classif_source' indicates which tool provided the classification.</p>
