# K-mer Dimensionality Reduction for Taxonomic Analysis

## Introduction

The k-mer dimensionality reduction tool is a component of the Assembly Screen for Cobionts and Contaminants (ASCC) pipeline, designed to enhance taxonomic analysis of genome assemblies. While traditional methods like [BlobToolKit](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org/) visualise sequences using GC content and coverage metrics (see [example GC-coverage plot](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ACVV01.blob_.square-1024x1024.png)), this tool provides complementary visualisations based on sequence composition through k-mer analysis.

### Purpose and Applications

The tool creates dimensionality reduction embeddings of k-mer counts, enabling the visualisation of taxonomic relationships between sequences in an assembly. The fundamental principle is that sequences sharing taxonomic origin tend to cluster together in these embeddings, with organellar sequences typically appearing distinct from their associated chromosomal sequences.

This approach is particularly valuable when:

- Analysing assemblies with complex species composition
- Working with environmental samples
- Examining assemblies containing 3-10 distinct taxonomic groups
- Processing datasets with 100 to several thousand sequences

### Integration with [BlobToolKit](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org/)

The tool seamlessly integrates with BlobToolKit, allowing users to:

- Add custom dimensionality reduction coordinates as variables in BlobToolKit datasets
- Interactively explore and select sequence clusters
- Generate lists of sequences belonging to specific clusters
- Complement traditional GC-coverage plots with alternative taxonomic visualisations

### Data Normalisation

Before applying dimensionality reduction methods, the k-mer count data is normalised to a range of 0 to 1. This normalisation step:

- Ensures all features contribute equally to the analysis
- Improves numerical stability during computation
- Makes the results more comparable across different sequences
- Helps prevent any single feature from dominating the analysis

## Validation Dataset

To demonstrate and evaluate the various dimensionality reduction methods, we use a synthetic dataset derived from complete genome assemblies. This dataset was specifically constructed to represent a realistic scenario of mixed genomic content while maintaining reliable taxonomic labels for validation purposes.

### Dataset Construction

The dataset was created by collecting complete genome sequences from diverse organisms:

- **Chlamydomonas reinhardtii**:
  - Nuclear genome (CM023806.1)
  - Chloroplast (NC_005353.1)
  - Mitochondrion (NC_001638.1)
- **Aspergillus fumigatus**:
  - Nuclear genome (NC_007194.1)
  - Mitochondrion (NC_017016.1)
- **Pseudooceanicola atlanticus** (CP051248.1)
- **Streptococcus agalactiae** (CP051848.1)
- **Brevibacterium siliguriense** (NZ_LT629766.1)
- **Halothece sp. PCC 7418** (NC_019779.1)
- **Methanofollis liminatans** (NZ_CM001555.1)

The sequences were fragmented with:

- Maximum length of 50 kb
- Resulting in 3,177 sequence fragments
- Total assembly size of 158 Mb
- Average fragment length of ~49.7 kb

### Dataset Characteristics

The dataset contains a taxonomically diverse mix of sequences:

- Eukaryotic (algal and fungal)
- Bacterial
- Archaeal
- Organellar (chloroplast and mitochondrial)

Key features:

- Represents multiple distinct taxonomic groups in a single dataset
- Includes both nuclear and organellar DNA from the same species
- Comprises sequences of uniform length (mostly 50 kb, with shorter fragments at contig ends)

### Rationale for Synthetic Dataset

This synthetic dataset was chosen over real environmental samples for several key reasons:

1. **Reliable Sequence Classifications**:

   - All sequences are publicly available
   - Pre-existing, high-confidence taxonomic classifications from NCBI

2. **Validation Independence**:

   - External classifications prevent circular validation when testing taxonomic separation methods

3. **Fragment Size Control**:

   - Uniform fragmentation helps evaluate method performance across consistent sequence lengths
   - Short sequences (â‰¤50 kb) represent the most difficult cases for taxonomic classification

4. **Statistical Power**:
   - The fragmentation process provides sufficient sequence count (>3,000)
   - Enables robust evaluation of dimensionality reduction methods

The dataset's characteristics make it particularly suitable for evaluating taxonomic separation methods, as it combines the complexity of multi-species genomic content with reliable reference classifications for validation.

## Available Methods

The tool implements multiple dimensionality reduction techniques, ranging from classical approaches to modern neural network-based methods. Based on empirical testing with our validation dataset, these methods can be broadly categorised by their effectiveness in taxonomic separation. Example visualisations for each method are available in the `kmers_dim_reduction_btk_figures` directory.

Spectral Embedding performs well in the Chlamydomonas dataset, showing clear separation between taxonomic groups despite being categorised as a method with limited testing in general evaluations.

### Intermediate-performing Methods

These methods show some separation between taxonomic groups, but the boundaries are less clear and clusters may overlap.

#### t-SNE

![t-SNE](kmers_dim_reduction_btk_plots/btk_datasets_CBD.blob.circle.t-SNE.png)

Hessian LLE performs poorly in separating taxonomic groups in this dataset.

## Pipeline Configuration

### YAML Configuration Options

#### k-mer Length

- Specified using the `kmer_len` key in the ASCC input YAML file
- Integer value specifying k-mer size
- Default: 7
- Affects both computation time and memory usage
- Larger values provide more specific patterns but require more memory

#### Dimensionality Reduction Methods

The selection of kmer count dimensionality reduction methods that will be run is specified in with the 'dimensionality_reduction_methods' key in the ASCC input YAML file. The methods are provided in the YAML file as a list, e.g. `["pca", "umap", "t-sne"]`.

Available methods:

- `pca`
- `umap`
- `t-sne`
- `isomap`
- `lle_standard`
- `lle_hessian`
- `lle_modified`
- `mds`
- `se`
- `random_trees`
- `kernel_pca`
- `pca_svd`
- `nmf`
- `autoencoder_relu`
- `autoencoder_sigmoid`
- `autoencoder_linear`
- `autoencoder_tanh`
- `autoencoder_selu`

### Pipeline Integration

- Activated by including `kmers` in the `--include` parameter when running the ASCC pipeline
- Automatically handles file paths and integration with BlobToolKit
- Manages intermediate files and results

## `n_neighbors` Parameter Optimisation

### Purpose

Automatically finds optimal `n_neighbors` value for applicable methods:

- UMAP
- Isomap
- LLE (`standard`, `hessian`, `modified`)
- Spectral Embedding

### How it Works

- Tests multiple `n_neighbors` values (typically 5, 10, 15, 20, 30)
- For each value:
  - Performs dimensionality reduction
  - Applies HDBSCAN clustering
  - Calculates silhouette scores
- Selects `n_neighbors` value with best average clustering quality

### When to Use

- Enabled by default (can be disabled with `--skip_n_neighbors_optimisation` of the `kmer_count_dim_reduction.py` script)
- Particularly useful when:
  - Dealing with new types of sequence data
  - Dataset size differs significantly from previous analyses
  - Optimal neighbourhood size is unknown

### Output

- Generates optimisation results file (`method_name_n_neighbors_optimisation.txt`)
  - Contains tested `n_neighbors` values and their scores
  - Helps understand parameter selection process
- Logs best `n_neighbors` value in console output
- Uses the best `n_neighbors` value for generating the final dimensionality reduction embedding that is passed on to the downstream processes
